    --InCollege Success Story--
    Avery Scott
    B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering (2019)
    Brooklyn, New York

    My responsibilities as a Project Manager are bringing order to chaos. I work with
    tens of teams across the company to understand future growth in production, any new
    product development and the requirements to support the growth of our services for
    millions of users worldwide. I work directly with my team to pull together the numbers
    and plans to produce machines across the globe. I am always meeting with different teams
    to keep up to date with what is currently being worked on so I can efficiently manage
    times on projects to ensure the best results in the given time.

    My acquisition of my current position as Project Manager would not have been possible
    without my enrollment in InCollege. In my Freshman and Sophomore years of college I
    was not very good at communicating with others in my department and building connections
    that would eventually lead me to my current position. I would go to class, study, eat
    and repeat without ever attempting to join clubs or get involved. I was recommended to
    join InCollege by a friend at the start of my Junior year, and that's when my college
    life really took off. I was instantly able to connect with others in my department, as
    well as those with similar interest. Next thing I know, I was building new connections
    almost every week, joining clubs and getting involved, and ultimately, falling in love
    with my major. Those connections I created during Junior year lead me to my current job,
    and I couldn't be more thankful for the opportunities InCollege allowed me to have.
