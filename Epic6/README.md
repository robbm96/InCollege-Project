# InCollege: USF Software Engineering Project

## Description:

This application is designed to allow college students to create personal accounts, upload profile information, search for and apply for jobs, and connect with other students both at their college and at other colleges. This application was assigned to us for our CEN 4020: Software Engineering class.

## Languages and Tools:

- Python
- Pytest

## Getting Started

If you are planning to run pytests, make sure to use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install pytest

```bash
pip install pytest
```

To run the test, use

```bash
pytest -s
```
in your terminal

**Note:** When running test, function inputs might need to be entered twice so that pytest can recognize them

Before you start the application, make sure the database.json file is in the same directory as app.py
To start the application, run 

```bash
python3 app.py
```
